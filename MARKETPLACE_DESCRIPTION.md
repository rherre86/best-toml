Best TOML is a lightweight TOML extension for Visual Studio Code.

It adds clean, modern syntax highlighting and language configuration for TOML 1.x files – perfect for
`pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `uv`, `Poetry`, `Ruff` and other TOML-based configuration files.

The extension is deliberately minimal and fast: no language server, no heavy dependencies – just a focused
editing experience with sensible defaults and a solid foundation for future improvements.
